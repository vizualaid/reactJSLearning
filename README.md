npm (short for Node Package Manager) is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.
 npm helps manage and share the packages (libraries, frameworks, tools, etc.) that you use in your projects, and makes it easy to install and update packages from the online registry. It also helps you manage package dependencies, so that you can be sure that the packages you use are all compatible with each other.
